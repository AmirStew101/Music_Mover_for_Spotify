# Music Mover for Spotify

An app made with Flutter to help reorder your Spotify playlists faster. It connects with Spotify to get playlists you have made and all the tracks within them. Users can then select multiple tracks to be moved, added, or removed in bulk. You can either move multiple tracks to another playlist or multiple playlists. You can add multiple tracks to another playlist/playlists or remove multiple tracks from a playlist.
